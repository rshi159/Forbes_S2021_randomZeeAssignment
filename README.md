# Forbes_S2021_randomZeeAssignment
Code to create random groupings for zees in Forbes College, Princeton University.

# Files to use. No argument inputs. Change stuff in the script at the top.
## randomGrouping_getAllParticipants.py 

reads from submissions.csv and outputs a .xlsx file of randomized people in groups of 4. Can change the number 
of people per group in the top section of code. [TODO] probably should add a main function that takes command line arguments.

## generate_people.ipynb

is a jupyter notebook that generates some test data from a random list of names. Randomizes numbers and each person makes 3 submissions.
